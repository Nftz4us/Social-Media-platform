# Social-Media-platform
The provided code establishes a basic framework for a social platform using Node.js and Express. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its components:

Dependencies: The code utilizes Express for server management and Mongoose for MongoDB interactions. Body-parser is used to parse incoming request bodies.

MongoDB Connection: The application connects to a MongoDB database named socialPlatform, which will store user data.

User Schema: A Mongoose schema defines the structure of user data, including fields for username, password, email, profile picture, and bio.

User Registration: The /register endpoint allows new users to create an account. It accepts a JSON payload containing the username, password, and email, and saves the new user to the database.

User Login: The /login endpoint authenticates users by checking the provided credentials against the database. If successful, it returns a success message; otherwise, it returns an error.

Privacy Policy Endpoint: The /privacy-policy endpoint serves a simple privacy policy outlining how user data is collected, used, and protected. This is crucial for building trust with users.

Server Initialization: Finally, the server listens on a specified port, allowing it to handle incoming requests.
